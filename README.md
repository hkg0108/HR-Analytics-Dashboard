# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
Power BI


# Project Overview
The HR Analytics project aims to provide insights into the organization's human resources data using a CSV dataset. The goal is to analyze various employee-related factors, identify trends, and support decision-making with data-driven insights.

# Objective:
To clean and preprocess the HR data, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
To create visualizations and measures to help HR understand the data, address issues like employee attrition, performance management, and employee satisfaction.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the "HR_Analytics.csv" file.
It contains multiple employee-related attributes such as employee ID, department, salary, years of experience, satisfaction level, and more.

# Tools Used

**1. Power BI**

Power BI was used for:

Data import from the CSV file.
Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, duplicate removal, ensuring correct data types).
Creation of calculated columns and measures to derive more meaningful insights.
Visualizations to aid decision-makers in analyzing key trends and metrics.

**2. Microsoft Excel (Optional)**
If necessary, Excel could be used to make initial adjustments to the CSV file before importing it into Power BI.

# Data Processing and Cleaning Steps

## Data Preprocessing

**Removing Null Values:** All rows containing null values were removed to ensure data integrity.

**Duplicate Removal:** Duplicates were identified and removed to avoid skewing of analysis.

**Spelling Errors and Data Inconsistencies:** Columns were reviewed for spelling mistakes or inconsistencies (e.g., department names or job titles) and corrected to maintain uniformity.

**Data Types Validation:** The data types were checked to ensure that columns (such as employee IDs, salaries, or dates) were correctly classified as integers, text, or dates.
Feature Engineering

## Creation of Additional Columns:

New columns were generated to enhance analysis, such as calculating employee tenure based on the date of joining or salary categorization.

## Measures:

Custom measures were created to calculate key metrics such as:

**Attrition Rate:** Percentage of employees who left over a specified period.

**Average Satisfaction Level:** Average employee satisfaction by department or job role.

**Total Salary Expenditure:** Total sum of salaries by department or location.

**Performance Rating Metrics:** Measures related to employee performance ratings and their impact on retention.

# Analysis & Visualizations
The project involved creating dashboards and reports that highlight:

**Attrition Analysis:** A detailed look at factors contributing to employee attrition and visualizations showcasing trends over time.
**Salary Distribution:** Analysis of salary ranges across different departments and job roles.
**Satisfaction Levels:** Visualizations tracking employee satisfaction across departments, years, and other key factors.
**Performance Management:** Insights into employee performance and the correlation between performance ratings and promotions or retention.

## Key Visualizations:
Bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to represent department-wise attrition, salary distribution, and employee performance.
Interactive dashboards allowing the user to filter data by department, job role, or years of experience.

# Conclusion
The HR Analytics project provided valuable insights into employee-related trends within the organization. By leveraging data cleaning, feature engineering, and advanced visualizations in Power BI, the project uncovered key factors impacting employee satisfaction, attrition, and overall HR performance. These insights can support strategic HR decision-making, such as improving retention strategies, optimizing salaries, and enhancing employee satisfaction.

# Next Steps:
Additional data can be incorporated for deeper insights, such as adding performance review data or external factors (e.g., industry benchmarks).
Further analysis can be done to predict future attrition or satisfaction levels using machine learning models.
